                I joined piggyvest while doing my NYSC, I used my PPA allowance but saved my federal government allowance. What I
                saved,
                I used it as an independent lady to learn how to drive, apply for my master's program, rent a house in Abuja, and
                learn
                some skills. If you have the spirit of saving, you can actually save from any income/money and Piggyvest is there to
                help me hold it till I need it.</p><br>
